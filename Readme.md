# Declaration
The reproducible analysis is the part of the dissertation of the CASA0012. All the sources have been acknowledged. 

# Ethical considertaions

The datasets utilized in this research can all be accessed on the Internet in the public domain. 

The datasets in this study may not be relevant to its original intended application. This study has applied potential pre-processes for the possible issues of the dataset, which, however, does not imply that the data source endorses any derivative data that processed in this study.

This research fell within the domain of University Research and was not subject to require the ethical review from UCLâ€™s Ethics Committee.

# Notebook Statement

The notebooks for reproducible analysis divided in to two parts: *Preprocessing.ipynb* for accessing the datasets as outlined in the Thesis and generate the rainfall sequence; *Resilience.ipynb* for evaluating the network connectivty, functionality and reslience in terms of travel time in the study area.

**To Note**: Though the notebooks attempt to optimise the reproducibility, there is still some certain restrictions which has been explictly explained and clarified in the Thesis. Procedures for processing in QGIS, HEC-RAS and StormDeck are described in the Thesis. Key features and raster layers for producing the layout are provided in *Processing_From_QGIS*
